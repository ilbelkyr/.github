These are the same guidelines that apply to any public repository I own
and maintain, so I can't really make any specific promises considering
some of them are one-off things or no longer actively updated.

Having said that, if there's something you think affects security,
please avoid reporting it on a public issue; instead, contact me about
it privately:

- email: [ilbelkyr@shalture.org](mailto:ilbelkyr@shalture.org)
- PGP (if preferred): [6E7C348A716E59FAC9E6D1A04B3896ABA96B3085][pgp]

I'll do my best to appropriately address your concern.

Thank you!
